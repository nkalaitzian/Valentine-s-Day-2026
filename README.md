## Prompt History
1. I want to create a simple valentine's day webpage that will have a question "Will you be my valentine?" and two buttons: Yes, No. The yes button will be clickable, but the no button will jump all around the webpage randomly
2. Awesome, can we change the graphics to something more minimalistic and with more pastel colors? Prefer burgundy, purple, pink and red
3. Great! Can we make the No button morph into a Yes button that's throbbing with a bright red border after 10 jumps? but when pressed, it won't trigger as the Yes button, but will instead make the no button reappear in a corner.
4. It needs to stop jumping around after the tenth jump to be clickable. After it's clicked it can start jumping around again
5. can we change the background into small hearts floating around?
also, can we make it look more cute?
Take the attached image as an example to make it look a bit cuter
6. The no button sometimes disappears altogether. I'm not sure if it might be getting shrunk to zero dimensions, or if it gets moved outside the dimensions of the browser window.
7. it still disappears after jumping around
8. Can you figure out what's wrong?
9. It still disappears
10. It got hidden again
11. Perfect!
Can we add a funny semi-angry text to appear on screen?
12. Great! can we add more lines (about 20 in total) and have a single one get chosen randomly?
Also, at the load of the page, can we have the two buttons be on the same line, centered vertically on the page?
13. They aren't exactly centered. The no button overlaps with the yes button.
14. The no button can get a bit easy to lose. can we make it stand out a bit more? keep the color pastel if you can.
Can we also make the jumps a bit smoother? less of a teleport action, more of a phasing or a sliding action. If you can, make the transition a bit cute by adding something special to it - improvise
15. the button disappeared again
16. Perfect!
Can we add a translation button at the corner that switches from Greek to English Language? along with the appropriate translations for all visible text. And add a cookie so that the browser remembers which language has been chosen.
17. Perfect! Can we make the Greek language the default one?
18. awesome! can we make the webpage mobile-friendly?
19. Great! for mobile devices though, there will be no cursor to hover, so we need to change the behavior of the no button to work differently for these cases
20. can we make it so when I click the yes button, the page will reset? not by a reload, but by resetting the buttons and the bottom text.
21. make the reset happen 5 seconds after the yes button is clicked
22. Can we add more supported languages? Let's add support for French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Polish, Chinese, Korean, Japanese
23. Awesome! Can we add alternative texts to "Μερικές ιστορίες αγάπης δεν επιτρέπουν το "όχι" 🐾"? Maybe 5 alternatives that get selected on page load.
24. Yeah, let's add rotating subtitles for the other languages as well. Feel free to switch up the tone of the text as well, use different emojis. Just keep it cute.
25. Yes, please add more variants and make them playful. Also, if you can, change the subtitle emojis for the greek language. The first 4 all use the same emoji.
26. Amazing! Can we also add an accessibility button next to the language select button? When inactive, it will display an accessibility icon, but if you click it, it will expand to reveal four buttons:
- + to decrease/increase font size
another button that will toggle colors for colorblinded people
and the fourth button will toggle between dark and light mode
27. Amazing. Can we have the accessibility settings be stored in a cookie like the language?
28. Amazing! Can we add a slight incognito footer at the bottom of the page that links to my ko-fi page?
https://ko-fi.com/pastouris
29. Let's make it more minimal, and can you add the github repository link as well?
https://github.com/nkalaitzian/Valentine-s-Day-2026
30. Maybe move the text to the lower-left corner.
31. Great!
Can we also add rotating emojis for the emoji header?
32. Actually, let's keep the emojis still
Let them change on page load, or when the yes button is clicked
33. Oh, let's also rotate the subtitle when the yes button is clicked
34. Can you create a simple README explaining what the page is?
Also, create a different section at the bottom of it, displaying every prompt I've asked you so far, from the beginning to the end. If I keep prompting you, add them to the end of the readme.
